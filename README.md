# Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this notebook, I'll demonstrate how to clean and prepare a raw dataset. I'll also run some preliminary analysis with the dataset after it has been prepared. From the reader, I assume a basic understanding of python-language and its data science libraries, namely numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

The dataset taken as an example is a collection of information on more than 470,000 artworks in the The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The steps I take for preparing the data are:

- Getting familiar with the dataset
- Subsetting columns
- Resetting the index
- Converting year-data to real numeric values
- Using string manipulation methods to clean columns with string-data
- Dealing with missing values
- Preliminary basic analysis
